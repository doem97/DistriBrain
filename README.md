# What we do?
DistriBrain aims to build a distributed brain for AIs, in a trustworthy and safe way.

AI is too powerful to be occupied/powered by a small group of people/company/gov/rich man. Good thing is that our private GPUs are powerful weapon: we can train powerful AI together by sharing our GPU resource, and build an AI that truely works for us. We dream that one day, everyone could contribute to and own the AI equally, and safely. The most advanced AIs should be a public property owned by all of the human. Every one can vote (based on contribution) to decide the future/usage of the powerful AI brain.

> Let the AI break down the walls among human.
