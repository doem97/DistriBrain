# DistriBrain
DistriBrain aims to build a Distributed Brain for AIs. We hope the future AI could be developed and owned by every human equally. We dream: there's one day, the AIs is not the priority of certain companies, government, or rich guys, but a public property owned by the whole world. Every device is part of this brain, we contribute together to train it, use it and make it safe.

> Let the brain distributed everywhere.
